# Todo App

A modern todo application built with Next.js and Supabase.

## Framework

This app is built using:
- Next.js 14 (App Router) - A React framework for building web applications
- TypeScript - For better code quality and type safety
- Tailwind CSS - For styling the user interface
- Supabase - For database and authentication

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Node.js 18.17 or later installed

## How to Run the App

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MeHappyLucky/todoappsoftarch.git
   cd todoappsoftarch
   cd todo-app
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Database Structure

The app uses Supabase with these tables:

1. `todos` table:
   - `id` - Unique identifier for each todo
   - `title` - The name of the todo task
   - `description` - More details about the task
   - `status` - Shows if the task is "In Progress" or "Done"
   - `created_at` - When the task was created
   - `updated_at` - When the task was last modified
   - `user_id` - Links the task to the user who created it

2. Authentication tables (managed by Supabase):
   - `auth.users` - Stores user accounts
   - `auth.identities` - Stores login methods
   - `auth.sessions` - Manages user sessions

## How the App Works

### User Authentication
- Users can create an account with their email and password
- Users can log in with their email and password
- If users forget their password, they can reset it
- The app keeps users logged in until they choose to log out
- Users are automatically redirected to login when accessing protected routes

     - Status (In Progress or Done)
     - Options to edit or delete

3. Managing Todos:
